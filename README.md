# Crime Analysis

## Crime Prediction Using Data Mining Techniques

The primary aim of this research is to apply various **data mining techniques** on open crime datasets from urbanized cities to:

- **Predict the type of crime** (classification)
- **Forecast the expected number of future crimes** (regression)

Two real-world datasets are used:
- **San Francisco (SF)** dataset for classification
- **New York City (NYC)** dataset for regression

Additionally, the research investigates how much training data is needed for the models to remain accurate and effective.

### Research Objectives

**Objective 1:**  
Identify the most effective **classification models**—from traditional machine learning to deep learning techniques—for predicting the **type of crime**, using features such as:
- Temporal information
- Spatial location
- Arrest occurrence

**Objective 2:**  
Determine the best **regression models** (also spanning traditional and deep learning methods) to **forecast future crime rates** over time.

**Objective 3:**  
Investigate the **minimum amount of training data** required by each model to maintain high performance, ensuring computational efficiency without sacrificing accuracy.
